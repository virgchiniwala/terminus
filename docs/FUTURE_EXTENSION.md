# FUTURE_EXTENSION.md
Last updated: 2026-02-17

## Purpose
Capture post-MVP extension ideas without polluting MVP scope.

This file is intentionally forward-looking and does not redefine current constraints.

## Power Mode (Future, Optional)
Power Mode is an opt-in advanced lane for users who want deeper control.

Possible capabilities:
- advanced execution diagnostics
- richer run policy controls
- hosted relay transport and managed plans
- stronger organizational controls and multi-user policy layers

## Guardrails for Power Mode
Power Mode must remain:
- explicitly opt-in
- separated from default onboarding
- constrained by policy and receipts
- compatible with object-first UX

Power Mode must not turn Terminus into:
- a chat-first product
- a developer harness
- an unconstrained execution environment

## Future Provider/Transport Lane
- relay-backed transport as backend lane
- centralized budget policy and routing
- no client-side secret exposure

## Future Ingestion Lane
Potential future additions outside MVP:
- authenticated inbox connectors
- richer source connectors
- team-level data governance controls

## Future Learning Lane
Potential future evolution:
- richer quality/noise scoring features
- safer personalization controls
- explainability dashboards for profile changes

All learning enhancements must preserve bounded adaptation and permission invariants.
