## Persona Focus
Solo professionals who already use AI assistants daily and want consistent follow-through with low setup effort.

## Story 1: Website Monitor (Founder)
As a founder, I want a site monitor that only alerts me when meaningful changes happen, so I can stay updated without noise.

Flow:
- I create an Autopilot from one sentence.
- It checks my selected website on schedule.
- If changes are meaningful, it prepares a concise draft update and requests approval.
- Over time, it learns what I ignore and reduces low-value alerts.

Value over time:
- fewer noisy notifications
- faster approvals
- better signal relevance

## Story 2: Inbox Triage (Operator)
As an operator, I want to paste a message and get a ready-to-review draft reply, so I can handle communication quickly.

Flow:
- I paste forwarded content.
- Terminus classifies and drafts a reply.
- I approve, edit, or reject.
- Over time, draft style aligns to my preferred length and tone.

Value over time:
- less rewrite effort
- consistent communication style
- reduced reply turnaround time

## Story 3: Daily Brief (PM)
As a PM, I want a single daily brief from my chosen sources, so I can start the day with only essential updates.

Flow:
- I configure a source set.
- Terminus compiles a daily summary card.
- I review and approve.
- Over time, it shrinks source scope and output length if I consistently ignore extra detail.

Value over time:
- lower reading overhead
- better summary relevance
- stable morning workflow

## Story 4: Trust Recovery
As a user, if a run fails or is blocked, I want to understand why and what to do next immediately.

Flow:
- Run ends with a clear receipt.
- I see reason + next steps (adjust scope, approve, retry later).
- The same failure does not produce duplicate side effects.

Value over time:
- confidence in automation
- predictable operation
- fewer support escalations
