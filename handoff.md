## What I Need from Vir

1. **Approval to proceed** with first 10 tasks after I define them
2. **Decision: Slack vs Email** for MVP notification integration (pick one to keep scope tight)
3. **LLM provider preference:** OpenAI (GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini) or Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku)?

---

## Suggested Next 3 Tasks (After Skeleton)

1. **UX Principles Doc** (Loki) — Design system, visual language, typography, spacing rules
2. **Wireframes** (Jarvis + Loki) — Text-spec wireframes for 6 key screens
3. **Threat Model** (Fury) — Security risks, mitigations, permission model validation

## Notes

- Execution model upgraded to Mission Control workflow
- All work now happens in local git repo
- Day/night modes established

- Ready to break down first 10 tasks and begin implementation
